# Australian-Job-Market-Intelligence
Comparative analysis of Data Analyst and Data Scientist job demand using Python

# Data Analyst vs Data Scientist

# Project Overview
This project analyzes real-world Australian job postings to compare demand, skills, and hiring trends for Data Analyst and Data Scientist roles.

# The goal is to understand:
- Which roles are more in demand
- What skills employers are looking for
- How job requirements differ between roles

# Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

# Dataset
Source: Kaggle  
The dataset consists of two CSV files:
- Australian Data Analyst job postings
- Australian Data Scientist job postings

# Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and schema standardization
- Merging multiple datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Skill extraction from job descriptions
- Comparative analysis by role and location
- Data visualization

# Key Insights
- Data Analyst roles emphasize SQL, Excel, and BI tools
- Data Scientist roles emphasize Python, Machine Learning, and Cloud platforms
- Job demand is concentrated in major metropolitan locations
- Skill requirements vary significantly by role

# Outcome
This project provides actionable insights for job seekers and students to align their skills with current market demand.
